# Mitigating class-imbalance in Machine Learning Models

This is a research project under Dr. D. S. Pawar, IIT Hyderabad.

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in machine learning, especially in problem statements like Fraud Detection.
This repository contains the code for conditional variations of re-sampling algorithms, which can be used to oversample the minority class in case of imbalanced classes in the datasets.

We have observed around 10% increase in our generalization performance on pedestrian gap-acceptance dataset when the data is re-sampled using this technique. The dataset with the details and results of our experiments will be published soon.
